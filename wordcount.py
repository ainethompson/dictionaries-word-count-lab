#Write a program, wordcount.py, that opens a file and counts how many times each 
#space-separated word occurs in that file. Your program should then print those 
#counts to the screen.

#Weâ€™ve included a small file, test.txt, that you can use for testing out your 
#script. The file contains this poem:#
